                    I've started creating websites at elementary school. Since 2019, I work as web
                    developer in Czech
                    company Jablotron. During
                    my career, I've made a couple of different websites, either for personal or
                    commercial use. You can find my public work on my GitHub account, or visit my personal page for more
                    information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My most favorite technologies used for web design are <b>PHP</b> for backend with framework Laravel
                    / Lumen
                    and <b>JavaScript</b> for frontend with framework Vue.js. I also have experience with Node.js,
                    Python and ASP.NET.

                    I've been playing floorball for over 14 years. For 10 years, I've also played for the team Florbal
                    Jablonec where I went through all the different categories and won numerous games.
                    Since the COVID-19 pandemic, I play only recreationally.

                <p>
                    This hobby is fairly new for me, as I own the drumkit only for 3 months. Other than practicing alone
                    or
                    with my friends who play different instruments, I also like experimenting with
                    different genres and sounds, and I'm playing almost everyday to improve as fast as possible.
